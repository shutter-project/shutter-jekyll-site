This is another bugfix release implementing further patches. Some upload plugins have been removed because the upload services have shut down (ITmages, Minus, TwitPic).

Following changes in dependencies are there: perl-json-xs has been superseded by perl-json-maybexs; perl-webservice-gyazo-b is a new optional dependency for upload to Gyazo.

Following update plugins are known to be still broken: Dropbox, vgy.me.
