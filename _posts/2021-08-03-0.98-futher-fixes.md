Fixes:
* show main window when launching Shutter and an instance is already running
* in selection mode allow to move the selection
* in selection mode allow to trigger the screenshot with doubleclick 
* fix the Print button
* when uploading a screenshot via FTP, copying the URL to clipboard is now functional
* fix the "Torn paper" and "Watermark" plugins
