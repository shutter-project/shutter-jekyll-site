New Shutter update, 0.96, is here! It drops dependency on Gtk2, and starts depending on Gtk3 instead.

More specifically, these perl dependencies are gone:
* Gtk2
* Gtk2::ImageView
* Gtk2::Unique
* Gtk2::AppIndicator
* Gnome2::Wnck
* Goo::Canvas

These dependencies are new:
* [Carp:::Always](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carp::Always)
* [Gtk3](https://metacpan.org/pod/Gtk3)
* [Gtk3::ImageView](https://metacpan.org/pod/Gtk3::ImageView) >= 9
* [GooCanvas2](https://metacpan.org/pod/GooCanvas2) (unlike old Goo::Canvas, this one is not optional anymore)
* [GooCanvas2::CairoTypes](https://metacpan.org/pod/GooCanvas2::CairoTypes)
* [Pango](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pango)
* [libwnck-3](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libwnck), used via Glib Object Introspection

The feature of taking a section of window is removed (or, rather, commented out), because it didn't work with the way how modern Qt and Gtk were drawing their windows anyway.

Possible issues:
* Multiple screens might or might not be broken
* HiDPI screens might do screenshot of a nested menu in a wrong place

If you encounter these, or other issue, and/or have an idea how to fix them, please tell us.
