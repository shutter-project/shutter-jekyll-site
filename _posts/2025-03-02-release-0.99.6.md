Bug fixes:

* Fixed sporadic crash on startup due to wrong usage of libwnck. The ability to take screenshot of a window is currently broken, but that's better than not starting at all.
* Fixed Pixelate tool in Draw to decrease leaking of data from under pixelation
* Fixed quality setting of PNG images

New features:

* Added AVIF format support

New optional dependency for AVIF support: Gdk Pixbuf loader from [libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif), e.g. [libavif-gdk-pixbuf](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libavif-gdk-pixbuf) in Debian, or as part of `libavif` package in some other distros.
