New version is available with the following improvements:

* Fixed several more regressions of the [Gtk3 switch](/releases/0.96/):
  * Fixed File->Open dialog
  * Fixed Autoscroll option of the Draw tool
* Added support for `gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3`, because some distros don't have `gir1.2-appindicator3` anymore. If neither of AppIndicator3 nor AyatanaAppIndicator3 is available, on some DEs you will miss the tray icon, so it's recommended to have at least one of these 2 libraries installed.
* Fixed schema of the appdata XML, use https in URLs in it
* Added search keywords to the shutter.desktop file
* Icons cleanup
  * Dropped a copy of the whole Tango icon set, which was usable from the Draw Tool. Any icon can still be imported from the the local disk, including even Tango ones if they are installed
  * Fixed shutter icon size
  * Removed duplication of the same icons
  * Removed logo images for dropped image hosters
