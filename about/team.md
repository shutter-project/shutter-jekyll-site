### The Team

**Mario Kemper**, developer and project founder (retired in 2014)

{% include image path="/assets/img/team/mario.jpg" id="mario" %} I work as a consultant with focus on software quality assurance. You might want to have a look at my [interview at https://blog.launchpad.net](http://blog.launchpad.net/projects/shutter) to read more about the reasons and goals of the project.

I am addicted to free software and community driven projects. In addition to modest abilities in C/C++, PHP, Java and some experiences with .NET languages I am mostly interested in Perl (Shutter is written in Perl as well) nowadays.

**Alexey Sokolov**, developer

**Vadim Peretokin**, promotion, web presence and interface design

I’m an IT healthcare student in YorkU, Toronto. I’m interested in promoting quality open-source software and my work in Shutter includes expanding its popularity and interface design. Programming languages of interest are C and Vala.

**Mike Heffner**, Fedora packaging, web presence

**Michael Kogan**, Arch Linux packaging, web presence, maintanance between 2017 and 2019

I studied theoretical physics in LMU Munich, will start my job as maths/physics teacher soon and am interested in eLearning technology. I got involved with Shutter from its early days as GScrot in 2008 by submitting the initial Russian translation and testing. In 2017 Shutter has been removed from the Arch Linux repositories to the AUR (Arch User Repository) and I took over the maintanence of its [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shutter/). At the same time I asked Mario for access to the Launchpad repository and applied patches which were submitted by other Launchpad users fixing minor bugs. However, my coding skills are very limited (mostly JS and PHP) and I never wrote a single code line for Shutter myself.
