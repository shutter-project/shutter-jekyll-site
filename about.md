## About

Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program for Linux based operating systems such as Ubuntu. You can take a screenshot of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a website – apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight points, and then upload to an image hosting site, all within one window. Shutter is free, [open-source](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php), and licensed under [GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

## Capture

Shutter allows you to capture nearly anything on your screen without loosing control over your screenshots (tabbed interface). Here is an overview of what you can do with Shutter:

* **Capture a Specific Area**  
  This allows you to select an arbitrary region of your screen and capture only those parts you really need. The screen can be zoomed and the selection can be resized or moved.
* **Capture your Desktop**  
  Shutter does not only capture all the contents of your desktop (or workspace) – it also supports Multi-monitor settings, e.g. capture the active monitor
* **Capture a Window**  
  Simply use your mouse to select the window you want to capture. Shutter will highlight the currently select window in an attractive and useful way. It is even possible to simply select a window from a list and capture it right a way.
* **Capture a Menu or Tooltip**  
  Capturing menus or tooltips is very easy with Shutter. You select one of the options and a (user-defined) countdown starts. During this time you can open the desired menu or let a specific tooltip come up. Shutter will recognize and capture it.
* **Capture a Website**  
  Shutter uses gnome-web-photo to capture a website without opening a browser window

## Edit

Especially if you are taking screenshots for writing tutorials or manuals you need to edit the image, e.g. highlighting some part of it. With Shutter you don’t need to open an external graphics editor like GIMP, because Shutter ships with its own built-in editor. Here are some of the most important features:

* **Add Text, Arrows, Rectangles, Ellipses…**  
  The built-in editor allows you to add primitives (e.g. rectangles, lines etc.) , arrows or text to your screenshot. Every shape can be customized by changing the color, fonts and/or the line width.
* **Censor / Pixelize to Hide Private Data**  
  Don’t want to show sensitive data like IP or e-Mail addresses? Shutter gives you two simple but effective tools to hide this data.
* **Auto-Increment Shape**  
  When writing a step-by-step guide people often add incremental digits to the screenshots (usually via text). Shutter offers a specific auto-increment shape that can be added to the screenshot. It cannot be easier!
* **Crop**  
  The built-in editor also includes a tool to crop your screenshot. Simply select a region with your mouse or enter the desired dimensions into the input fields.

## Share

We all spend much of our time in forums, wikis, chats etc. From time to time we need to do some screenshots and upload them so we can share them with other people.

* **Share easily**  
  Shutter has a built-in function to upload your screenshot with nice link-formatting so you can post the generated link directly in the forum, wiki etc.

## Plugins

Shutter ships with a great variety of plugins that allow you to add impressive effects to your screenshots.

* **Give Unique Look to Your Screenshots**
