### Third Party Packages

Shutter depends on several outdated libraries and therefore has been removed from some distribuitions' official repositories. Currently a GTK3 port is underway such that Shutter can be packaged for repositories again. In the mean time here is how you get the latest Shutter version for some distributions:

#### Arch Linux

A [package for Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shutter/) is available in the AUR (Arch User Repository).

#### Debian

There are [official Debian packages](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=shutter&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) available in the oldstable and oldoldstable distrubution (Stretch and Jessie).

You can install Shutter by using the package manager or the following command:

~~~
apt-get install shutter
~~~


#### Fedora

Shutter is available in Fedora’s official repository, so just install it with:

~~~

Also, the most recent Shutter version can be installed using this [copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mheffner/shutter/).
